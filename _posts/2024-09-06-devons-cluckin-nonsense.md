## Intro

As of today, _Cache Miss_, my second indie album, is now available on streaming services. To celebrate, I thought I'd take a moment to look back at what went on in the creation of my first album, _Devon's Cluckin' Nonsense_, along with its B-sides and cut content.

Curious? Put one on in the background while you read this post! The images above are clickable. :)

So why is this chicken surfing on a tortilla chip over a stream of nacho cheese in space? Read on to find out.

## The Album

Devon's Cluckin' Nonsense as a whole is a collection of tracks I made during a period of loneliness and self-discovery. It was senior year of high school, and senioritis was in full swing. My grades went down the toilet due to excessive abscences, and I was spending more time alone than ever before. I was also constantly worrying about what I'd do after graduation, on top of trying to figure out my gender identity, all while my parents were expecting me to be the same "gifted" kid they've always known since kindergarten. Things were a mess, but they were a necessary mess. This album represents such a mess by being a sort of collage of different "styles" of making music in the genre of electronic and psychedelic rock music.

## The Tracks

### Sour Grapes

The album starts off with a very energetic track which I made nearing the end of high school. You hear the drums come in from afar, and then the synths kick in for a bit before the vocals. The song is somewhat explicit about its theme; it's about someone who feels that they could spend most of their life alone in their room, drifting apart from their friends. It's a little satirical, but still very accurate to how I was feeling at the time. It's easy to isolate from your peers and pretend you can live without them, but in the long run, that feeling of loneliness will always creep into your life no matter how hard you try to convince yourself that your computer and piano are all you need.

This track is very special to me because it's my first mix that could even somewhat compare to a "professional" mix. All my other tracks around this time were really quiet compared to my favorite songs from other artists. It's also the only track I've done so far that I'm somewhat proud of the vocals for. I've never taken any lessons on singing, and I just kinda wing it when I record vocals, which explains why a lot of my tracks are instrumental. This one is unusually decent compared to the usual crap that goes my mic, and I was able to lean into the autotune for a nice effect rather than trying to hide it.
