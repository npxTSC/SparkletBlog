## Intro

As of today, _Cache Miss_, my second indie album, is now available on streaming services. To celebrate, I thought I'd take a moment to look back at what went on in the creation of my first album, _Devon's Cluckin' Nonsense_, along with its B-sides and cut content.

Curious? Put one on in the background while you read this post! The images above are clickable. :)

So why is this chicken surfing on a tortilla chip over a stream of nacho cheese in space? Read on to find out.

## The Album

Devon's Cluckin' Nonsense as a whole is a collection of tracks I made during a period of loneliness and self-discovery. It was senior year of high school, and senioritis was in full swing. My grades went down the toilet due to excessive abscences, and I was spending more time alone than ever before. I was also constantly worrying about what I'd do after graduation, on top of trying to figure out my gender identity, all while my parents were expecting me to be the same "gifted" kid they've always known since kindergarten. Things were a mess, but they were a necessary mess. This album represents such a mess by being a sort of collage of different "styles" of making music in the genre of electronic and psychedelic rock music.

## The Tracks

### Sour Grapes

The album starts off with a very energetic track which I made nearing the end of high school. You hear the drums come in from afar, and then the synths kick in for a bit before the vocals. The song is somewhat explicit about its theme; it's about someone who feels that they could spend most of their life alone in their room, drifting apart from their friends. It's a little satirical, but still very accurate to how I was feeling at the time. It's easy to isolate from your peers and pretend you can live without them, but in the long run, that feeling of loneliness will always creep into your life no matter how hard you try to convince yourself that your computer and piano are all you need. I really needed someone to tell me to "touch grass" at the time.

This track is very special to me because it's my first mix that could even somewhat compare to a "professional" mix. All my other tracks around this time were really quiet compared to my favorite songs from other artists. It's also the only track I've done so far that I'm somewhat proud of the vocals for. I've never taken any lessons on singing, and I just kinda wing it when I record vocals, which explains why a lot of my tracks are instrumental. This one is unusually decent compared to the usual crap that goes my mic, and I was able to lean into the autotune for a nice effect rather than trying to hide it.

The track was released as a single along with Fuenteovejuna and Purple Girl (Instrumental) as a sort of preview, but has since been taken down to deduplicate.

### External Data Bus

Picture this: You've spent the past 7 hours learning about networking at school, and you get on the bus to go home. You walk all the way to the back to sit down at your usual spot-- the one seat that only has room for a single person. People all around you are talking, but you have nobody to sit next to. You put on your earbuds and try to let the music drown out the noise as your lean your head against the window. That's the world this track is meant to take you to.

The above is a true story, and it happened every time school was over for the day. The guitar in this track represents the music playing on my earbuds, trying to drown out the ambient. Throughout the entire track, the sound of people talking doesn't stop, because the feelings of isolation aren't constrained to just a single bus ride. No, you'll feel that way at lunch time, or walking down the hall and seeing a group of friends talking about something you're interested in. There is no running away from the feeling, and it must be addressed directly.

This track is special to me because it was my first time recording anything on an electric guitar. During my time being institutionalized for my depression, I was bored as hell with no access to my online friends or my music, and promised myself I'd learn guitar as soon as I got out. I created most of the track before this, but I decided to overdub it with a real recording reversed at the end of the track because I realized how easy it was to play. The only chords on the electric guitar part are E and D, both some of the first chords any newbie guitar player learns to play.

It's also special to me because it was my first time trying a new synth. Around this time, I bought Serum, a wavetable synthesizer plugin, and I was trying to learn how to use it. The fuzzy synth in this track is a preset I made myself using saw waves. I named it "External" and saved it for use in other tracks as you'll see later. I still use it in a lot of my tracks today.

### Kayleigh

Following the topic of loneliness, we have a more upbeat and positive track about remembering the good times with someone you used to know. This track, originally named "For Kayleigh," is about a friend I had in elementary school who I lost touch with after she moved to a different state. It makes me sound like an old man to say this, but most kids nowadays will not know the experience of losing a friend due to lack of contact methods. I still remember her and have the cute Pikachu hat she gave me on my birthday. I hope she's doing well.

This has a chiptune synth, high violins, and a soft piano; it has everything you need to make a song sound nostalgic. ðŸ˜†

### Serialize Love

With these next 2 tracks, we take a break from the territory of loneliness and just mess around for a bit for fun with no particular meaning. Serialize Love is a track I made inspired by Lena Raine and the Celeste soundtrack. I made the bass yet again in Serum, and tried to make it really over-the-top like the deep synth that kicks in near the end of Mr. Oshiro's hotel. I also put a phaser over it to make it sound a little less boring since it's constantly humming away in the background. The chiptune part at the end was a little bit "do whatever and see what works," because I threw my bit of music theory knowledge out the window and just placed notes until it sounded nice.

### Deserialize Love

This track was made as a challenge. One of my Discord friends sent me a royalty-free quack sound effect, and asked me to make a beat out of it. Sure enough, I did, over one of my old near-empty projects. For the middle section where it glitches out, a little cool trick I used was to put Valhalla Shimmer on the glitch bus and use the "wave" transition pattern with a really quick frequency to make the glitched sound effect seem like it has a pitch. The Shimmer keeps the sound going even after the glitch effect goes back to normal. The flow of this track is basically whatever I feel like slapping onto the end of the playlist in FL, so it just kinda goes on and on with new elements of the song coming in and out.

The piano and synth combo thing at the end is actually a preset I use in a lot of P/E/T/S soundtrack music, and it's supposed to be Agent Cascade's "voice." It's 3 different instrument plugins combined and mixed using Patcher, but I'll leave it up to you guys to figure out what those plugins are. ðŸ˜‰

### No Dice, No Signal

_"Oh, I can't believe the sun is gaining height, oh wait, I've been staring at this screen for 50 nights!"_

No Dice, No Signal was at first a song about the feeling of never being able to quite make friends. Every friend I've ever made was from pure chance and circumstance. I've never really been able to go up to someone and just ask if they want to be friends. I've always been too scared to do that, ever since I was little and someone on the playground told me you "can't be friends with someone you just met." Being an undiagnosed autistic person back then didn't help either. This track did have lyrics, but I cut them out as it was a little too personal to include on my first album. I guess just come up with your own lyrics for this one...? ðŸ˜…

In terms of instruments, this track uses a fork and spoon! I recorded the clanging of a fork and spoon together and dropped it right into a sampler and used it just like any other drum sample starting from the middle section. If I recall correctly, this track uses the External synth as well (although very high-pitched), nearing the end.

### Keep Your Eyes On The Road

A lot of these tracks have been more of just "electronic/rock with phasers and flangers put over them", but this one is truly a track I'm willing to say is "actual" psychedelic rock. The track still to this day makes me feel a little dizzy, but in a good way. I wanted to make a track that sounded like the background music of a really long road trip. The guitar and main synth are pretty repetitive, but that's kinda the point. The track is supposed to be a little hypnotic, and I hope it's able to take you to that place.

I'm so happy someone on YouTube commented that they liked the album and specifically this song. It really made my day. ðŸ’œ

I did a lot of "effect clownery" in this track:

- I hard-panned the sampled guitar to one side, inspired by the piano part in the beginning of Apocalypse Dreams by Tame Impala. I used to absolutely hate hard-panning in music I'd listen to, but his music showed me it's not so bad if you can do it right. I'll try to do it more often in the future, and more subtly to avoid pissing off people like myself.
- I got a little creative and made it so the piano has a delay effect on it, but only on the high frequencies. This makes it sound a little bit like a bell or chime. Sorta makes it stand out more in the mix, you know?
- The master track even has a flanger + tremolo patcher and a mono + phaser + auto-panning patcher as well. Yes, that part near the end sounds the way it does because the entire track is being combined into a mono signal and then put through a phaser to make it stereo again.
- I used this one free plugin called STFU (very epic plugin name) by Zeek Audio for sidechaining, but very explicitly. I love using this plugin subtly in most of my tracks, but in this one, it made for a neat "break" from the repetition when I turn it on for a measure right after the mono phaser part.

Overall, I just really like effects plugins and automation! What more is there to say? ðŸ˜…

### Legal Modifications

I made this one in like 30-60 minutes just for fun. This is a remake of a track I made around 2021 called "Troublesome Modifications" for the P/E/T/S soundtrack. The original chords were Cm and Aâ™­m, but I changed it to D and E to sound more upbeat. I used a classic 707 drum kit for that retro feel, and reused the External synth. For the bass, I tried something new; I used Ultra Analog Session 2, a plugin that came with my MIDI keyboard for free. I like how the bass on this track turned out, although in hindsight I feel I made the classic noob mistake of mixing the bass too loud relative to the other instruments. I don't really mind it, though. As a wise Reddit comment once told me, "if it sounds good, it sounds good." ðŸ”¥

The chords D and E may sound familiar to you from the section about _External Data Bus_. Well, this track was the _second_ one I recorded on my guitar, and it's the same chords as _External Data Bus_. I guess beginner me just really liked those 2 chords, looking for any possible song to play using them. It is what it is. ðŸ˜…

### Purple Girl

This is probably my favorite song on the album, although personally I prefer the instrumental over the one with lyrics. It's the most "complete" track I've ever made, and it's the one I'm most proud of.

## Cut Content

### Volatile Dream

The original name of this album was going to be Volatile Dream. I wanted a name that:

- Was related to tech nerds
- Was related to psychedelic rock or "dreams"
- Sounded cool

I ultimately settled on this idea from a friend, because `volatile` is a keyword in C programming, and the word itself also represented my emotions at the time. The name contains the word "Dream" as well, so it ticked all the boxes.

### Album Covers

Here are the first and second covers for "Volatile Dream," making a reference to a line from _From\<Fire\>_. The first one was for the WIP tracks, so it's a pretty rough doodle. It's overlayed with a Quine program in Python, which just means it's a program that prints its own source code. I made it fancy with matrix effects and stuff on the quine output as well. The second one includes some Rust code at the bottom, but I went for a more simple design. There's an easter egg in the WIP sketch. See if you can find it. ðŸ˜‰

Here are some more unused covers for the album. I made them all myself in Blender. At first, I wanted to make a chicken with some nacho cheese, but it felt a little off, so I went to make a second more simpler cover with a striped pattern. I ended up not using the striped ones because it didn't seem creative enough to just put a chicken over a striped background that doesn't really have a meaning. It also felt too similar to the background of Melophobia by Cage the Elephant. So yeah, I scrapped that idea and went back to the first revision. The one without flowing nacho cheese just felt like something was missing, and the nacho cheese flowing from the top of the cover was a little odd.
