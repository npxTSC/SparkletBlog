## Intro

As of writing this, _Cache Miss_, my second indie album, is now available on streaming services. To celebrate, I thought I'd take a moment to look back at what went on in the creation of my first album, _Devon's Cluckin' Nonsense_, along with its B-sides and cut content.

Curious? Put one on in the background while you read this post! The images above are clickable. :)

So why is this chicken surfing on a tortilla chip over a stream of nacho cheese in space? Read on to find out. (or skip to the [Devon](#devon) section if you're busy)

## The Album

Devon's Cluckin' Nonsense as a whole is a collection of tracks I made during a period of loneliness and self-discovery. It was senior year of high school, and senioritis was in full swing. My grades went down the toilet due to excessive abscences, and I was spending more time alone than ever before. I was also constantly worrying about what I'd do after graduation, on top of trying to figure out my gender identity, all while my parents were expecting me to be the same "gifted" kid they've always known since kindergarten. Things were a mess, but they were a necessary mess. This album represents such a mess by being a sort of collage of different "styles" of making music in the genre of electronic and psychedelic rock music.

## The Tracks

I'm leaving out _The Liability_, _The Sticky Note_, and _Serialize Love (Volatile Mix)_ because there isn't really much to say about them. I made them just for fun, and didn't really put much thought or meaning into them. They're just beats for the sake of beats. I'm also not including any tracks from singles that were "taken down" before later being reuploaded as part of _Cache Miss_. If you have any specific questions, I'd still be willing to answer them. 😊

### Sour Grapes

The album starts off with a very energetic track which I made nearing the end of high school. You hear the drums come in from afar, and then the synths kick in for a bit before the vocals. The song is somewhat explicit about its theme; it's about someone who feels that they could spend most of their life alone in their room, drifting apart from their friends. It's a little satirical, but still very accurate to how I was feeling at the time. It's easy to isolate from your peers and pretend you can live without them, but in the long run, that feeling of loneliness will always creep into your life no matter how hard you try to convince yourself that your computer and piano are all you need. I really needed someone to tell me to "touch grass" at the time.

This track is very special to me because it's my first mix that could even somewhat compare to a "professional" mix. All my other tracks around this time were really quiet compared to my favorite songs from other artists. It's also the only track I've done so far that I'm somewhat proud of the vocals for. I've never taken any lessons on singing, and I just kinda wing it when I record vocals, which explains why a lot of my tracks are instrumental (lol). This one is unusually decent compared to the usual crap that goes my mic, and I was able to lean into the autotune for a nice effect rather than trying to hide it.

The track was released as a single along with _Fuenteovejuna_ and _Purple Girl (Instrumental)_ as a sort of preview, but has since been taken down to deduplicate.

### External Data Bus

Picture this: You've spent the past 7 hours learning about networking at school, and you get on the bus to go home. You walk all the way to the back to sit down at your usual spot-- the one seat that only has room for a single person. People all around you are talking, but you have nobody to sit next to. You put on your earbuds and try to let the music drown out the noise as your lean your head against the window. That's the world this track is meant to take you to.

The above is a true story, and it happened every time school was over for the day. The guitar in this track represents the music playing on my earbuds, trying to drown out the ambient. Throughout the entire track, the sound of people talking doesn't stop, because the feelings of isolation aren't constrained to just a single bus ride. No, you'll feel that way at lunch time, or walking down the hall and seeing a group of friends talking about something you're interested in. There is no running away from the feeling, and it must be addressed directly.

This track is special to me because it was my first time recording anything on an electric guitar. During my time at the hospital for my depression, I was bored as hell with no access to my online friends or my music, and promised myself I'd learn guitar as soon as I got out. I created most of the track on my computer before this, but I decided to overdub it with a real recording reversed at the end of the track because I realized how easy it was to play. The only chords on the electric guitar part are E and D, both some of the first chords any newbie guitar player learns to play.

It's also special to me because it was my first time trying a new synth. Around this time, I bought Serum, a wavetable synthesizer plugin, and I was trying to learn how to use it. The fuzzy synth in this track is a preset I made myself using saw waves. I named it "External" and saved it for use in other tracks as you'll see later. I still use it in a lot of my tracks today.

### Kayleigh

Following the topic of loneliness, we have a more upbeat and positive track about remembering the good times with someone you used to know. This track, originally named "For Kayleigh," is about a friend I had in elementary school who I lost touch with after she moved to a different state. It makes me sound like an old man to say this, but most kids nowadays will not know the experience of losing a friend due to lack of contact methods. I still remember her and still have the cute Pikachu hat she gave me on my birthday. I hope she's doing well.

This has a chiptune synth, high violins, and a soft piano; it has everything you need to make a song sound nostalgic. 😆

### Serialize Love

With these next 2 tracks, we take a break from the territory of loneliness and just mess around for a bit for fun with no particular meaning. Serialize Love is a track I made inspired by Lena Raine and the Celeste soundtrack. I made the bass yet again in Serum, and tried to make it really over-the-top like the deep synth that kicks in near the end of Mr. Oshiro's hotel. I also put a phaser over it to make it sound a little less boring since it's constantly humming away in the background. The chiptune part at the end was a little bit "do whatever and see what works," because I threw my bit of music theory knowledge out the window and just placed notes until it sounded nice.

### Deserialize Love

This track was made as a challenge. One of my Discord friends sent me a royalty-free quack sound effect, and asked me to make a beat out of it. Sure enough, I did, over one of my old near-empty projects. For the middle section where it glitches out, a little cool trick I used was to put Valhalla Shimmer on the glitch bus and use the "wave" transition pattern with a really quick frequency to make the glitched sound effect seem like it has a pitch. The Shimmer keeps the sound going even after the glitch effect goes back to normal. The flow of this track is basically whatever I feel like slapping onto the end of the playlist in FL, so it just kinda goes on and on with new elements of the song coming in and out.

The piano and synth combo thing at the end is actually a preset I use in a lot of P/E/T/S soundtrack music, and it's supposed to be Agent Cascade's "voice." It's 3 different instrument plugins combined and mixed using Patcher, but I'll leave it up to you guys to figure out what those plugins are. 😉

### No Dice, No Signal

_"Oh, I can't believe the sun is gaining height, oh wait, I've been staring at this screen for 50 nights!"_

_No Dice, No Signal_ was at first a song about the feeling of never being able to quite make friends. Every friend I've ever made was from pure chance and circumstance. I've never really been able to go up to someone and just ask if they want to be friends. I've always been too scared to do that, ever since I was little and someone on the playground told me you "can't be friends with someone you just met." Being an undiagnosed autistic person back then didn't help either. This track did have lyrics, but I cut them out as it was a little too personal to include on my first album. I guess just come up with your own lyrics for this one...? 😅

In terms of instruments, this track uses a fork and spoon! I recorded the clanging of a fork and spoon together and dropped it right into a sampler and used it just like any other drum sample starting from the middle section. If I recall correctly, this track uses the External synth as well (although very high-pitched), nearing the end.

**_"Guess I'll redirect my feelings to /dev/null!"_**

### Keep Your Eyes On The Road

A lot of these tracks have been more of just "electronic/rock with phasers and flangers put over them", but this one is truly a track I'm willing to say is "actual" psychedelic rock. The track still to this day makes me feel a little dizzy, but in a good way. I wanted to make a track that sounded like the background music of a really long road trip. The guitar and main synth are pretty repetitive, but that's kinda the point. The track is supposed to be a little hypnotic, and I hope it's able to take you to that place.

I'm so happy someone on YouTube commented that they liked the album and specifically this song. It really made my day. 💜

I did a lot of "effect clownery" in this track:

- I hard-panned the sampled guitar to one side, inspired by the piano part in the beginning of Apocalypse Dreams by Tame Impala. I used to absolutely hate hard-panning in music I'd listen to, but his music showed me it's not so bad if you can do it right. I'll try to do it more often in the future, and more subtly to avoid pissing off people like myself.
- I got a little creative and made it so the piano has a delay effect on it, but only on the high frequencies. This makes it sound a little bit like a bell or chime. Sorta makes it stand out more in the mix, you know?
- The master track even has a flanger + tremolo patcher and a mono + phaser + auto-panning patcher as well. Yes, that part near the end sounds the way it does because the entire track is being combined into a mono signal and then put through a phaser to make it stereo again.
  - ![Master track mono effect](/assets/img/dcn/mono-pan-phase.png){: .w-50 }
- I used this one free plugin called STFU (very epic plugin name) by Zeek Audio for sidechaining, but very explicitly. I love using this plugin subtly in most of my tracks, but in this one, it made for a neat "break" from the repetition when I turn it on for a measure right after the mono phaser part.

Overall, I just really like effects plugins and automation! What more is there to say? 😅

### Legal Modifications

I made this one in like 30-60 minutes just for fun. This is a remake of a track I made around 2021 called "Troublesome Modifications" for the P/E/T/S soundtrack. The original chords were Cm and A♭m, but I changed it to D and E to sound more upbeat. I used a classic 707 drum kit for that retro feel, and reused the External synth. For the bass, I tried something new; I used Ultra Analog Session 2, a plugin that came with my MIDI keyboard for free. I like how the bass on this track turned out, although in hindsight I feel I made the classic noob mistake of mixing the bass too loud relative to the other instruments. I don't really mind it, though. As a wise Reddit comment once told me, "if it sounds good, it sounds good." 🔥

One trick I love to use that's especially noticeable on this track is to hard-pan an instrument to the left, and send its reverb to the right (or vice versa). It's a neat way to make the stereo field wider without making the track sound too muddy. I did that on the guitar but also the high-pitched synth (not External but the other one) on this track.

![Hard-panning trick](/assets/img/dcn/patcher-hardpan.png){: .w-50 }

The chords D and E may sound familiar to you from the section about _External Data Bus_. Well, this track was the _second_ one I recorded on my guitar, and it's the same chords as _External Data Bus_. I guess beginner me just really liked those 2 chords, looking for any possible song to play using them. It is what it is. 😅

I was worried about the length, but one of my friends assured me that sometimes it's fine to cut a track short if you think that's the best it'll ever be. I'm glad I did, because otherwise the track would have probably been very repetitive.

### Purple Girl

This is probably my favorite song on the album, although personally I prefer the instrumental over the one with lyrics. It's the most "complete" track I've ever made, and it's the one I'm most proud of. I had a listen to _Let it Happen_ by Tame Impala and thought the pattern of repeating every 3 bars instead of 4 was really interesting so I gave it a shot in my own style with my own chords and melody. The drum beat is the usual, but with way more cymbal stuff going on instead of the hi hat rolls. The last piano bit is a result of just forcing myself to improv some rhythm in the song's key, and although I suck at improv, it wasn't too difficult since the track is in C Major.

I got permission from FairyPrincessLucy, a voice tutorial creator on YouTube, to use a segment of one of her videos in the song. The video was somewhat inspirational to me at the time, and I thought it would be a nice touch to include it in the song. It matches the theme of the song, which is about life as a trans person who still hasn't come out to anyone yet and is absolutely terrified of doing so. The "try something" in this case would be to come out to your parents, while the "continue to be unhappy" is the option of doing nothing because you're afraid for your future and what might happen if you do.

Remember how I said I used the External synth in _External Data Bus_? Well, I used it in this track too, but with a twist. I automated the decay time so that at first when it plays the C/E chord, the synth sounds more like a pluck or stab, whereas when it plays B/D, it sounds more like a pad. Yeah, that's the same exact synth, just with one parameter now automated! I thought it was a creative way to make the synth sound more dynamic without having to mess with effects or anything. Wub wub wub. 🥸

![Hard clipping](/assets/img/dcn/waveshaper.png){: .w-25 .right }

Now, why purple? Because I started liking purple and black more than orange around the same time I started high school and my egg cracked. The song is written in third person. That's all there really is to it. More on this in the _From\<Fire\>_ section.

One trick I used extensively in this track is to just slap on a hard clipper to get a little extra loudness out of a few mixer tracks. I don't know if this even counts as a "trick" because most producers do this anyway, but this track was one of the first times I really used it all over the place. Even on the spoken word part at the end, I put a hard clipper over it to give the voice that gritty color.

For the drums around the 2-3 minute mark, I made them sorta fade out into noise by putting a flanger AFTER the "permanent" reverb, along with a second more pronounced temporary reverb right after the flanger again. Then, I achieved that rhythm through the noise by using Gross Beat for volume automation.

And how did I get the piano to sound so crispy? I went a little off the usual path and decided to write up a Patcher preset to split the signal into 2 bands of low and high frequencies, and then put a fuzz effect on the high frequencies. I used a free plugin called FuzzPlus3, which emulates the sound of a guitar fuzz pedal. The issue is, in doing so, this plugin only outputs mono, so I made a separate Patcher preset that splits a stereo signal into left and right and applies this plugin to both sides in mono before recombining them back to stereo. After all this, I put some subtle delay on the fuzzed band just to emphasize it a little. Lots of Patcher clownery involved just to get the piano to sound the way it did here. 😉

Anyway, I have this song stuck in my head now because I played it to practice "songs with Bmin" on guitar, so that's nice. 😅

### Identity Function

This one used to have lyrics as well, but honestly I just thought they were too cringe to include. I drew some heavy inspiration from Dual Core's track _All The Things_, which I originally found out about through my favorite podcast _Darknet Diaries_. After discovering the genre of "nerdcore," I knew I had to give it a try. Maybe someday I'll release a version with lyrics, but for now, it's just an instrumental because I still kinda like how the mix turned out enough to upload it. Not really one of my favorites, but it's whatever.

The main synth is built from a square wave in Sytrus. Not much else to it. This track doesn't have that many instruments playing at once.

Again with the WaveShaper. I soft-clipped the flute-like sample to make it sound really distorted near the end. 🤘

### From\<Fire\>

First of all, it pisses me off that I can't use the angle bracket symbols in a song title. It's 2024, people. **_Escape_** your damn inputs, **_don't_** sanitize them! It's not my fault you don't know how to code! Anyway, secondly, I deeply regret uploading this track too early. The instrumental in the B-sides is mastered properly (at least to my standards), but the original one with lyrics sounds too damn quiet because I was a noob back then. Oh, well. I'll just have to live with it.

Back on topic, this track is all about burnout and coming of age. Get it? Burnout? Fire? It's 3 different jokes in one title. Whatever. 😛

It's about the feeling of being overwhelmed with the concept of moving out and being independent from your parents. This again ties into what I said in _Purple Girl_ about not coming out; this track is a bit about the feeling of having to race the clock to be independent before you can live the way you want... but it's a vicious cycle! Thinking too much about wanting to be independent can make the negative thoughts just consume your mind all day and night, which makes you unable to function and do all the things required in order to be independent. I'd rather leave the actual lyrics in this one up to interpretation, though.

In terms of mixing, I panned a lot to keep stuff sounding separate here. Piano to the right, guitar synth to the left, organ synth slightly left to balance out the piano, and flute further right just to fill that space.

The vocals are kinda meh on this track. Don't really like how they turned out, personally. I only record when I'm home alone, and I was desperate for just an hour to record. It probably would have sounded better if I had more time. At least something I liked about working on vocals here was the sheer number of effects I was able to spam:

- Used a plugin called MAutoPitch to formant shift the vocals. When I sang "Why would you run from the guy?", I was able to make it sound really deep, as if it's someone else asking me that same question.
- Used Fruity Squeeze and MTremolo to bitcrush the vocals. There were a few parts where I didn't really want the words to be as audible, so I just bitcrushed them a bit, rather than making an annoying cut-out in the audio clip. It also helps achieve that separation of who's speaking in the song, for example when I say "I don't even know."

A little backstory: this track was originally a part of the P/E/T/S soundtrack, but I decided to copy it, redo the mix, and add lyrics to upload as a part of this album. If I remember correctly, this was the 1 track that inspired me to start an actual album, as before this I was only making music for the game. Having started it so early, you could technically say I spent a "whole year" on this, but most of that time was spent ignoring this project in my "do later" folder. This is also where the line "purple and black" comes from; the track is Agent Cascade's theme. She has a similar life situation to what I do, and her clothes' colors are purple and black.

Oddly enough, my inspiration was the Team Flare battle theme from Pokémon X and Y. I was on a flight, playing the game on my 3DS for the 32767th time, and I was like... "Hey, I could make a track that sounds this fire-y and hot, but maybe a little calmer! Yeah, that could work. That could work." It's the whole reason I had the idea to use an organ synth, too. I composed it as soon as I got home, while in the middle of drying my hair after a shower. 😆

> It's 3 different jokes in one title.

If you know the other 2 things the title is a reference to, you get a free reward of: absolutely nothing. 😃

💜 **Fleeing Blissfully!** 💜

### Falling, Falling

Nearing the end of the album, I wanted to start putting more "chill" tracks in. While this one does have a pretty heavy drum beat, it's definitely more relaxing than the other tracks. _Falling, Falling_ is something I came up with while messing around on guitar. I switched between D and Dmaj7, and realized it sounded kinda nostalgic. I then added a simple melody on top of it, and the track was born. That's why it's so short; I wanted it to be something small and sweet to lead into the final track.

### Let Those Colors Run

And there we have it, the final track of the album. Ending on the most calm track of them all, this one was written on the last day of Pride Month and is about exactly what it sounds like: not having to hide who you are anymore. The theme of the album slowly shifts from isolation, to anxiety about the future, to finally hopeful optimism. It's a nice way to end the album, and I'm glad I gave it a try. Once again, I ran short on recording time, except none of my recordings were remotely viable so I decided to make the track entirely instrumental rather than waiting another month or so for more time alone.

The sample that plays after the intro and kicks in at the end again is actually the sound of a pig oinking! I got it from a royalty-free sound effects website, and I thought it would be a neat touch to include it in the track just for fun. I distorted it to hell and back, then pitched it down quite a bit, and put a chorus over it to make it sound less overpowering over the other instruments. I love pigs! 🐷

The title is a tribute to Tame Impala, as he was a huge influence on me during the creation of this album.

### Fuenteovejuna

I'm not really a lofi hip-hop creator, but I wanted to give it a shot. It's a fairly simple track, with only a few instruments, but I put more of my focus on the effects chains. Some notable effects combos include:

- Reverb on a Rhodes piano. It makes it sound kinda nostalgic and soft, and puts the piano a little further back in the mix.
- Transient Processor on literally everything. Don't ask why I did this, because I don't remember and it's super cursed. 😬
  - But it sounds good, so I guess that's all that matters.
- Ping-pong delay on the clack sound with high feedback. Any time the clack sound is rolled, the delay makes it sound like it's bouncing all around the room. Pretty nice effect, but I wouldn't use it often. It really fits this track, though.

You may recognize the bells part in this track as the same melody from _From\<Fire\>_. This has no real meaning, and was just done for fun (or maybe it was stuck in my head... who knows? 😊).

This track was cut from the album because it was a little too different from the rest of the tracks. I still like it, though, so I decided to include it in the B-sides.

### Better Than Never

While this one has the most likes out of all my tracks, I really think it might be one of my worst. Just an opinion.

This track was made while I was in quite the pickle. I had a crush on my friend from school, but they seemed to already be in a relationship with someone else, though I never confirmed it. Upon having this suspicion, I felt really down, because I was of the opinion that my friend would be objectively better off with the other person than with me, so I didn't know what to do with my feelings. Knowing I'd never willingly confess my feelings to them, I decided to make a track about it instead as a form of catharsis. The title comes from the fact that not asking someone out leaves your relationship in a superposition of "maybe someday" which is better than getting a response of "no" and knowing you'll never be with them.

It's weird, because later on, I found out my friend was actually single and was trying to distance themselves from the other friend due to some uncomfortable texts. I guess I just misinterpreted the situation, but I'm glad I made the track anyway. It's a good reminder to me that sometimes, things aren't what they seem.

Alright, enough relationship drama. Let's talk about the track itself. This was my first time using a vocoder in any of my tracks. For those who don't know what a vocoder is, think of Daft Punk's _Around the World_ or _Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger_. It's that robotic voice effect, done by playing a synth and using vocals to modulate which frequencies of that synth are played. I used the vocoder to make the second part's vocals sound more robotic to give the track a more "electronic" feel.

This track also makes heavy use of STFU, the sidechain plugin I mentioned earlier. I used it to make the drums really punchy, and make them cut through the cello and bass.

This track was cut from the album simply because it doesn't fit the themes of isolation and identity, and I also didn't think anyone would like it. Guess I was wrong about that second part. 😅

## Cut Content

### Volatile Dream

The original name of this album was going to be Volatile Dream. I wanted a name that:

- Was related to tech nerds
- Was related to psychedelic rock or "dreams"
- Sounded cool

I ultimately settled on this idea from a friend, because `volatile` is a keyword in the C programming language, and the word itself also accurately described my emotions at the time. The name contains the word "Dream" as well, so it ticked all the boxes.

### Album Covers

Here are the first and second covers for "Volatile Dream," making a reference to a line from _From\<Fire\>_. The first one was for the WIP tracks, so it's a pretty rough doodle. It's overlayed with a Quine program in Python, which just means it's a program that prints its own source code. I made it fancy with matrix effects and stuff on the quine output as well. The second one includes some Rust code at the bottom, but I went for a more simple design. There's an easter egg in the WIP sketch. See if you can find it. 😉

Here are some more unused covers for the album. I made them all myself in Blender. At first, I wanted to make a chicken with some nacho cheese, but it felt a little off, so I went to make a second more simpler cover with a striped pattern. I ended up not using the striped ones because it didn't seem creative enough to just put a chicken over a striped background that doesn't really have a meaning. It also felt too similar to the background of Melophobia by Cage the Elephant. So yeah, I scrapped that idea and went back to the first revision. The one without flowing nacho cheese just felt like something was missing, and the nacho cheese flowing from the top of the cover was a little odd.

## Devon

So we're finally getting to the reason why the album cover depicts a chicken surfing on nacho cheese. 😌

I could write a whole separate blog post on who Devon is, but I'll try to keep it brief. He is a fictional character I created for a ChatGPT jailbreak prompt which has sort of turned into a joke with my friends. Here are the main points you need to know:

- He drives around in a stolen FBI Surveillance Van full of nacho cheese in the back
- He named his phone hotspot "FBI Cheese Van #13" to make people laugh when they open their WiFi settings
- He knows Rust, and writes malware for fun in his free time
- He is not afraid of swear words, unlike ChatGPT

Now, how is this related to chickens? Well, a friend decided to turn Devon into a Minecraft plugin, so you could chat with him through Minecraft commands on a server. One time, we were talking about the "chicken or egg first" problem, so we decided to consult Devon for his opinion using the command. He said none of it mattered, because at the end of the day, it's all just a bunch of "cluckin' nonsense." And that's where the album name came from, and why we associate Devon the AI with chickens now.

While I was brainstorming names for the album, I started going into the territory of just pure absurdity. I thought about how I could make the album cover as absurd as possible, and I thought about the chicken surfing on nacho cheese with a tortilla chip. I thought it was a funny idea, so I went with it. The album cover was made in Blender, and the chicken was (poorly) made by me from scratch. The nacho cheese was made using a fluid simulation. Cluckin' nonsense! 🐓

## Conclusion

So I hope that explains the creative process behind some of _Devon's Cluckin' Nonsense_! I hope you enjoyed reading this post and listening to the album. If you have any questions or advice, feel free to drop them below. Hope you have a great day! 😊
